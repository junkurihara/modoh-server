Relay for Oblivious DoH (ODoH) and ODoH-based Mutualized Oblivious DNS (ODoH-based &mu;ODNS; &mu;ODoH) supporting authenticated connection, written in Rust.

> **NOTE: This is a re-implementation of only the relay function of [https://github.com/junkurihara/doh-server](https://github.com/junkurihara/doh-server). This means the re-implementation does not support the target server function. Note that in &mu;ODoH, the target server is fully compatible with that of ODoH.**

> **NOTE: For &mu;ODNS, please see also [https://junkurihara.github.io/dns/](https://junkurihara.github.io/dns/) and other repositories listed there.**
